Certainly, the many climate scientists, policy experts, social scientists and others who had gathered at Stanford University agreed with the conclusions of the <a href='http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/'>latest United Nations reports</a> on rising global temperatures: that climate change is real, human activity is the main cause, and the impacts are already being felt. And not just in far off polar regions, but right here in the Bay Area, too. But as former Norwegian prime minister Gro Brundtland stepped to the microphone to deliver a keynote address on the urgent need for leadership in sustainable, low-emission development, she pulled her flowing purple blouse and scarves closer, against the auditorium’s chilled air. The air conditioner was out of control, creating artificially frigid conditions despite the pleasant California warmth outside. Like Brundtland, many at the “Connecting the Dots 2014” conference were left wishing they’d brought an extra sweater - they were caught unprepared, in other words, by an unexpected change in the (indoor) climate."}

Shifting to energy technologies that emit less carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses would reduce emissions significantly, as shown by the RCP2.6 or 4.5 lines. Failing to do so may land us around a RCP8.5 scenario, with ever-increasing emissions and and intensifying climate change.
